Bank number is at Base 4 of date difference when input YYYY-MM-DD and when only base 11 and base 12 are integers instead of HEX

For example, today is Tuesday, the input date is next Tuesday date, add 7 days, sometimes, base 5 and base 6, sometimes, base 10 and base 9

when matched base 3 and base 4, it will search past records that matched base 3 and base 4, if found it, choose the second and fifth ball numbers of the recent matched

But the method is deprecated after 2019.

The Mark six operation guys are choosing numbers from FootBall Magazine.
