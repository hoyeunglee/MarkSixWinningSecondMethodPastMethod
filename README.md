Mark Six Pyramid method and html is designed and invented Ho Yeung, Lee with Chatgpt tool.

Bank number is at Base 4 of date difference when input YYYY-MM-DD and when only base 11 and base 12 are integers instead of HEX

For example, today is Tuesday, the input date is next Tuesday date, add 7 days, sometimes, base 5 and base 6, sometimes, base 10 and base 9
if next Tuesday not worked, then it will move to Next Thursday and next round.
Reference date usually have some, but may be changed. I am using year 1994 and also 2000-01-01, 2003-01-01, 1990-01-01. 

when matched base 3 and base 4, it will search past records that matched base 3 and base 4, if found it, choose the second and fifth ball numbers of the recent matched.

It also used calendar method that show the colour of the numbers after the position of mark six drawing date.

But the method is deprecated after 2019.

The Mark six operation guys are choosing numbers from FootBall Magazine.
